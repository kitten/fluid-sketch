      This is a small concept design for the Find N2
      cover screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      The design features circles and reacts to the
      accelerometer/orientation sensors of the device.
      (Not fully functional in all browsers in this demo)
    </p>

    <p>
      The design features fluid/variable typography and
      to make it feel active and alive, and the motion
      it features intends to ground and connect it to the
      real world, and the deviceâ€™s form factor.
